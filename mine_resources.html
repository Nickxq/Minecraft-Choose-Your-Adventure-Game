      <div class="description">
        You venture into the small cave, wooden pickaxe in hand. Stone breaks easily, and 
        you gather cobblestone for a furnace. As you mine deeper, you spot coal ore embedded 
        in the wall - jackpot! Time passes quickly underground. Suddenly you realize the 
        light from the cave entrance has changed from golden to orange to dark purple. The 
        sun is setting. You hear groaning sounds echoing from deeper in the cave. Do you 
        push your luck and keep mining for more resources? Or head back to the surface now 
        while you still can?
