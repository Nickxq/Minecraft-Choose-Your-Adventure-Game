        You head toward the cluster of oak trees. Their leaves rustle peacefully overhead, 
        and sunlight filters through the canopy in golden shafts. The forest floor is 
        carpeted with fallen leaves and tall grass. You approach the nearest tree and examine 
        its sturdy trunk - perfect for gathering wood. But movement catches your eye deeper 
        in the forest. Through the trees, you spot wooden structures - a village! Smoke rises 
        from chimneys. You could gather materials here, or investigate that settlement.
