        You approach the merchant peacefully. He examines the wood, cobblestone, and coal 
        you've gathered. He nods approvingly and offers you food, better tools, and even 
        shows you a bed you can use. As night falls, you're welcomed into the village. The 
        villagers teach you their ways, show you their farms, and trade you iron tools. The 
        Iron Golem stands guard, but you're safe under its protection now. You've found a 
        community! With their help, you'll thrive in this world. Your adventure has just 
        begun - but you've survived and made powerful allies. Victory!
