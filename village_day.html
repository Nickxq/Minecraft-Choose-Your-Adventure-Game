      <div class="title">Among Villagers</div>
      <div class="description">
        You enter the village during daylight. Villagers regard you curiously but not 
        hostilely. One approaches - a merchant in a brown robe. He gestures to his wares: 
        food, tools, even an enchanted iron sword. He'll trade for emeralds or other 
        valuables. You notice the villagers have chests in their homes filled with supplies. 
        You could try honest trading with what you have... or you could sneak into one of 
        the houses and help yourself when no one's looking. But the Iron Golem patrols nearby, 
        watching for any sign of aggression.
