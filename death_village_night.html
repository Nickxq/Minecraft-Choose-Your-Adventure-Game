        You wait too long. The sun sets completely, and darkness blankets the village. The 
        villagers have locked themselves inside their homes. You approach the village gates 
        in the dark, hoping to find shelter. But the Iron Golem's glowing red eyes spot you 
        immediately. In the darkness, you look just like a zombie or skeleton - a threat to 
        the village. The massive guardian charges toward you with earth-shaking steps. You 
        try to explain, to show you're friendly, but it's too late. The Iron Golem's fist 
        slams down. The last thing you see is its expressionless face looming above.
